I have created a video for how to install and test the program,
see the private video:


1) Unzip the .ZIP file

2) Import into IntelliJ as an existing project

3) Open the "terminal" tab in IntelliJ and run the command:
     mvn clean install

5) Open the class: "MyApplication" and launch the application

6) Open in browser and paste this string:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config#/

7) Now you can test via swagger

8) Installation and Test, the link is not public  ( Select 1080p )
